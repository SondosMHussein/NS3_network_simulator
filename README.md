# NS3 network simulator.

# Description

 create an adhoc vehicular topology in NS3 using WaveMacHelper:
1. The simulation contains 3 vehicles (nodes)
2. The vehicles are mobile on a rectangular area according to RandomWalk2dMobility model (30 marks):

• The area is a rectangle with bounds 0<x<500 and 0<y<500. 

• The speed of the vehicles is a uniform random number between 8 m/s and 13 m/s. 

• Vehicles are initially positioned randomly on the rectangular area. In order to set the initial positions of 
the vehicles randomly, and use “RandomRectanglePositionAllocator”.
